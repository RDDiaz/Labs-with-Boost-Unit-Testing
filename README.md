# Labs-with-Boost-Unit-Testing
Various Lab Assignments using Boost Unit Testing

## Project Descriptions

### Lists and Lists2

In this lab we created a simplified version of the Standard Template Library's vector class.
In order to avoid confusion we called our class sequence. A sequence holds a collection of values.
Values may be added and removed from the sequence. The values in a sequence are associated with an
index but a value's index may change as items are added or removed from the sequence.

### BigInt class

In this lab we were tasked with creating our own BigInt class and to test our solution using BOOST.
BigInts were created by taking 'long long' values and storing each individual digit in an array.
The assignment also required us to implement methods for comparison, addition, subtraction and multiplication of BigInts.
